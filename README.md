# libsoftimpl
1	Installation
To execute the case study, you need to clone the git repository. The repository is available at https://github.com/Tronje182/libsoftimpl. To clone the repository download and install a git client like https://git-scm.com/ and use the clone link (https://github.com/Tronje182/libsoftimpl.git) for the Lib-Soft repository to create your local repository.
Additionally, you need the JavaScript runtime Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/). Node.js comes with the JavaScript package manager npm (https://www.npmjs.com/) already installed. Npm is used to install dependencies and run the application locally.
2	Run LibSoft
To run LibSoft for the first time, you need to install the dependencies first. This only has to be done again if the dependencies in the package.json change. You can start this process by opening a command line in the repository folder and enter >npm install. 
To run the application, if all dependencies are installed, open the command line interface in the re-pository folder and enter >npm start. The application will be then available at the URL http://localhost:3000/.
3	Open Libsoft on other devices
To open LibSoft on other devices an easy way is to forward the port of your personal computer to the internet.
